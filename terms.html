      <h1>Muve Terms of Service</h1>
      <hr style="width:50px; color: #2ECC71; background-color: #2ECC71; height: 2px; margin: 0px;" />

      <p style="margin-top: 20px;">
        These Terms of Service (“Terms”) govern your access to and use of the Muve Services, including any Muve mobile applications, websites and channels (the “Services”), and any images, videos, information, text, graphics, photos or other materials uploaded,
        downloaded or appearing on the Services (collectively referred to as “Content”). You agree that by registering or by using the Services, you are entering a legally binding agreement with Muve [Muve LLC], located at Cincinnati, Ohio (“Muve”) based
        on the Terms and the Privacy Policy, which is hereby incorporated by reference (collectively referred to as the “Agreement”). Your access to and use of the Services is conditioned on your acceptance of and compliance with the Agreement. By accessing
        or using the Services you agree to be bound by the Agreement.
      </p>

      <h2>1. Basic Terms</h2>
      <hr style="width:50px; color: #2ECC71; background-color: #2ECC71; height: 2px; margin: 0px;" />

      <p style="margin-top: 20px;">
        You are responsible for your use of the Services, for any Content you post to the Services, and for any consequences thereof. You may use the Services only if you can form a binding contract with Muve and are not a person barred from receiving services
        under the laws of the United States or other applicable jurisdiction. If you are under 18 years of age you may only use the Services under the direct consent and supervision of your parent or legal guardian. Anyone under 13 years of age may not
        use or access the Services for any reason. Please contact us if you are aware that a person under 13 is using the Services. If you are accepting these Terms and using the Services on behalf of a company, organization, government, or other legal
        entity, you represent and warrant that you are authorized to do so. You may use the Services only in compliance with these Terms and all applicable local, state, national, and international laws, rules and regulations. The Services are always
        evolving and the form and nature of the Services may change from time to time without prior notice to you. In addition, Muve may stop (permanently or temporarily) providing the Services (or any features within the Services) to you or to users
        generally and may not be able to provide you with prior notice. We also retain the right to create limits on use and storage at our sole discretion at any time without prior notice to you. The Services may include advertisements, which may be
        targeted to the Content or information on the Services, queries made through the Services, or other information. The types and extent of advertising on the Services are subject to change. In consideration for Muve granting you access to and use
        of the Services, you agree that Muve, third party providers and partners may place such advertising on the Services or in connection with the display of Content or information from the Services whether submitted by you or others.
      </p>

      <h2>2. Privacy</h2>
      <hr style="width:50px; color: #2ECC71; background-color: #2ECC71; height: 2px; margin: 0px;" />

      <p style="margin-top: 20px;">
        Any information that you provide to Muve is subject to our Privacy Policy, which governs our collection and use of your information. You understand that through your use of the Services you consent to the collection and use (as set forth in the Privacy
        Policy) of this information, including the transfer of this information to the United States and/or other countries for storage, processing and use by Muve. As part of providing you the Services, we may need to provide you with certain communications,
        such as service announcements and administrative messages. These communications are considered part of the Services and your Muve account, which you may not be able to opt-out from receiving.
      </p>

      <h2>3. Passwords</h2>
      <hr style="width:50px; color: #2ECC71; background-color: #2ECC71; height: 2px; margin: 0px;" />

      <p style="margin-top: 20px;">
        You are responsible for safeguarding the password or credentials that you use to access the Services and for any activities or actions under your account. We encourage you to use “strong” passwords (passwords that use a combination of upper and lower
        case letters, numbers and symbols) with your account and with other accounts that you may connect to your Muve account. Muve cannot and will not be liable for any loss or damage arising from your failure to comply with the above requirements.
      </p>

      <h2>4. Content On the Services</h2>
      <hr style="width:50px; color: #2ECC71; background-color: #2ECC71; height: 2px; margin: 0px;" />

      <p style="margin-top: 20px;">
        The Services constitute a technology platform that enables users of Muve’s mobile applications or websites provided as part of the Services (each, an "Application") to arrange and schedule moving and/or logistics services with third party providers of
        such services, including independent third party moving providers and third party logistics providers under agreement with Muve or certain of Muve’s subsidiaries ("Third Party Providers"). Unless otherwise agreed by Muve in a separate written
        agreement with you, the Services are made available solely for your personal, noncommercial use.
        <br />
        <br /> YOU ACKNOWLEDGE THAT MUVE DOES NOT PROVIDE MOVING OR LOGISTICS SERVICES OR FUNCTION AS A MOVING CARRIER. MUVE’S SERVICES MAY BE USED BY YOU TO REQUEST AND SCHEDULE MOVING OR LOGISTICS SERVICES WITH THIRD PARTY PROVIDERS, BUT YOU AGREE THAT
        MUVE HAS NO RESPONSIBILITY OR LIABILITY TO YOU RELATED TO ANY MOVING OR LOGISTICS PROVIDED TO YOU BY THIRD PARTY PROVIDERS THROUGH THE USE OF THE SERVICES OTHER THAN AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THESE TERMS. MUVE DOES NOT GUARANTEE THE SUITABILITY,
        SAFETY OR ABILITY OF THIRD PARTY PROVIDERS. IT IS SOLELY YOUR RESPONSIBILITY TO DETERMINE IF A THIRD PARTY PROVIDER WILL MEET YOUR NEEDS AND EXPECTATIONS. MUVE WILL NOT PARTICIPATE IN DISPUTES BETWEEN YOU AND A THIRD PARTY PROVIDER. BY USING THE
        SERVICES, YOU ACKNOWLEDGE THAT YOU MAY BE EXPOSED TO SITUATIONS INVOLVING THIRD PARTY PROVIDERS THAT ARE POTENTIALLY UNSAFE, OFFENSIVE, HARMFUL TO MINORS, OR OTHERWISE OBJECTIONABLE, AND THAT USE OF THIRD PARTY PROVIDERS ARRANGED OR SCHEDULED
        USING THE SERVICES IS AT YOUR OWN RISK AND JUDGMENT. MUVE SHALL NOT HAVE ANY LIABILITY ARISING FROM OR IN ANY WAY RELATED TO YOUR TRANSACTIONS OR RELATIONSHIP WITH THIRD PARTY PROVIDERS.
        <br />
        <br /> All Content is the sole responsibility of the person who originated such Content. We may, but are not required to monitor or control the Content posted via the Services and we cannot take responsibility for such Content. Any use or reliance
        on any Content or materials posted via the Services or obtained by you through the Services is at your own risk. We do not endorse, support, represent or guarantee the completeness, truthfulness, accuracy, or reliability of any Content or communications
        posted via the Services or endorse any opinions expressed via the Services. You understand that by using the Services, you may be exposed to Content that might be offensive, harmful, inaccurate or otherwise inappropriate, or in some cases, postings
        that have been mislabeled or are otherwise deceptive. Under no circumstances will Muve be liable in any way for any Content, including, but not limited to, any errors or omissions in any Content, or any loss or damage of any kind incurred as a
        result of the use of any Content posted, emailed, transmitted or otherwise made available via the Services or broadcast elsewhere. We may offer you the opportunity to invite your friends or contacts to enjoy the Services. If you choose to invite
        one or more of your friends or contacts using text messaging (SMS), we may suggest content for the message. You can edit that suggested content, and if you choose to send text message invitations, those messages will be sent from the native SMS
        application on your device. If you do choose to send such invitations, you represent to Muve that the recipients of such invitations have consented to receive such messages from you, and that those recipients do not consider such messages unwanted
        or unsolicited.
      </p>

      <h2>5. Your Rights</h2>
      <hr style="width:50px; color: #2ECC71; background-color: #2ECC71; height: 2px; margin: 0px;" />

      <p style="margin-top: 20px;">
        You retain your rights to any Content you submit or post or display on or through the Services. In order to make the Services available to you and other users, Muve needs a license from you. By submitting, posting or displaying Content on or through the
        Services, you grant us a worldwide, non-exclusive, royalty-free license (with the right to sublicense) to use, copy, reproduce, process, adapt, modify, publish, transmit, display and distribute such Content in any and all media or distribution
        methods (now known or later developed). You agree that this license includes the right for Muve to provide, promote, and improve the Services and to make Content submitted to or through the Services available to other companies, organizations
        or individuals who partner with Muve for the syndication, broadcast, distribution or publication of such Content on other media and services, subject to our terms and conditions for such Content use. Such additional uses by Muve, or other companies,
        organizations or individuals who partner with Muve, may be made with no compensation paid to you with respect to the Content that you submit, post, transmit or otherwise make available through the Services. We may modify or adapt your Content
        in order to transmit, display or distribute it over computer networks and in various media and/or make changes to your Content as are necessary to conform and adapt that Content to any requirements or limitations of any networks, devices, services
        or media. You are responsible for your use of the Services, for any Content you provide, and for any consequences thereof, including the use of your Content by other users and our third party partners. Muve will not be responsible or liable for
        any use of your Content by Muve in accordance with these Terms. You represent and warrant that you have all the rights, power and authority necessary to grant the rights granted herein to any Content that you submit.
      </p>

      <h2>6. Your License To Use The Services</h2>
      <hr style="width:50px; color: #2ECC71; background-color: #2ECC71; height: 2px; margin: 0px;" />

      <p style="margin-top: 20px;">
        Muve gives you a personal, worldwide, royalty-free, non-assignable and non-exclusive license to use the software that is provided to you by Muve as part of the Services. This license is for the sole purpose of enabling you to use and enjoy the benefit
        of the Services, in the manner permitted by these Terms.
        <br />
        <br />
        <strong>USER ACCOUNTS</strong>
        <br />
        <br /> In order to use most aspects of the Services, you must register for and maintain an active personal user Services account ("Account"). You must be at least 18 years of age, or the age of legal majority in your jurisdiction (if different
        than 18), to obtain an Account. Account registration requires you to submit to Muve certain personal information, such as your name, address, mobile phone number and age, as well as at least one valid credit card. You agree to maintain accurate,
        complete, and up-to-date information in your Account. Your failure to maintain accurate, complete, and up-to-date Account information, including having an invalid or expired credit card on file, may result in your inability to access and use the
        Services or Muve’s termination of this Agreement with you. You are responsible for all activity that occurs under your Account, and, as such, you agree to maintain the security and secrecy of your Account username and password at all times. Unless
        otherwise permitted by Muve in writing, you may only possess one Account.
        <br />
        <br />
        <strong>USER REQUIREMENTS AND CONDUCT</strong>
        <br />
        <br /> The Service is not available for use by persons under the age of 18. You may not authorize third parties to use your Account, and you may not allow persons under the age of 18 to receive moving or logistics services from Third Party Providers
        unless they are accompanied by you. You may not assign or otherwise transfer your Account to any other person or entity. You agree to comply with all applicable laws when using the Services, and you may only use the Services for lawful purposes
        (e.g., no transport of unlawful or hazardous materials). You will not in your use of the Services cause nuisance, annoyance, inconvenience, or property damage, whether to the Third Party Provider or any other party. In certain instances Muve may
        require you to provide proof of identity to access or use the Services, and you agree that you may be denied access or use of the Services if you refuse to provide proof of identity. The Muve app was designed for on-demand hauling and moving of
        your items, not for you personally. Any driver who transports a user during the transaction, is doing so completely under their own personal insurance and liability. This is not a service that Muve provides. This breaches your agreement with Muve.
        Please use your best judgment and proceed with caution before getting in the vehicle with another person.
        <br />
        <br />
        <strong>TEXT MESSAGING</strong>
        <br />
        <br /> By creating an Account, you agree that the Services may send you informational text (SMS) messages as part of the normal business operation of your use of the Services. You acknowledge that opting out of receiving text (SMS) messages may
        impact your use of the Services.
        <br />
        <br />
        <strong>PROMOTIONAL CODES</strong>
        <br />
        <br /> Muve may, in Muve’s sole discretion, create promotional codes that may be redeemed for Account credit or other features or benefits related to a Third Party Provider's services, subject to terms that Muve establish on a per promotional
        code basis ("Promo Codes"). You agree that Promo Codes: (i) must be used for the intended audience and purpose, and in a lawful manner; (ii) may not be duplicated, sold or transferred in any manner, or made available to the general public, unless
        expressly permitted by Muve; (iii) may be disabled by Muve at any time for any reason without liability to Muve; (iv) may only be used pursuant to the specific terms that Muve establish for such Promo Code; (v) are not valid for cash; and (vi)
        may expire prior to your use. Muve reserves the right to withhold or deduct credits or other features or benefits obtained through the use of Promo Codes by you or any other user in the event that Muve determines or believes that the use or redemption
        of the Promo Code was in error, fraudulent, illegal, or in violation of the applicable Promo Code terms or these Terms.
        <br />
        <br />
        <strong>NETWORK ACCESS AND DEVICES</strong>
        <br />
        <br /> You are responsible for obtaining the data network access necessary to use the Services. Your mobile network's data and messaging rates and fees may apply if you access or use the Services from a wireless-enabled device. You are responsible
        for acquiring and updating compatible hardware or devices necessary to access and use the Services and Applications and any updates thereto. Muve does not guarantee that the Services, or any portion thereof, will function on any particular hardware
        or devices. In addition, the Services may be subject to malfunctions and delays inherent in the use of the Internet and electronic communications.
      </p>

        investigation of potential violations hereof, (iii) detect, prevent, or otherwise address fraud, security or technical issues, (iv) respond to user support requests, or (v) protect the rights, property or safety of Muve, its users and the public.
        Muve does not disclose personally identifying information to third parties except in accordance with our Privacy Policy.
        <br />
        <br /> You may not do any of the following while accessing or using the Services: (i) access, tamper with, or use non-public areas of the Services, Muve's computer systems, or the technical delivery systems of Muve providers; (ii) probe, scan,
        or test the vulnerability of any system or network or breach or circumvent any security or authentication measures; (iii) access or search or attempt to access or search the Services by any means (automated or otherwise) other than through our

        prior consent of Muve is expressly prohibited); (iv) forge any TCP/IP packet header or any part of the header information in any email or posting, or in any way use the Services to send altered, deceptive or false source-identifying information;
        or (v) interfere with, or disrupt, (or attempt to do so), the access of any user, host or network, including, without limitation, sending a virus, overloading, flooding, spamming, mail-bombing the Services, or by scripting the creation of Content

      <h2>9. Copyright Policy</h2>
      <hr style="width:50px; color: #2ECC71; background-color: #2ECC71; height: 2px; margin: 0px;" />

      <p style="margin-top: 20px;">
        Muve respects the intellectual property rights of others and expects users of the Services to do the same. We will respond to notices of alleged copyright infringement that comply with applicable law and are properly provided to us. If you believe that
        your Content has been copied in a way that constitutes copyright infringement, please provide us with the following information: (i) a physical or electronic signature of the copyright owner or a person authorized to act on their behalf; (ii)
        identification of the copyrighted work claimed to have been infringed; (iii) identification of the material that is claimed to be infringing or to be the subject of infringing activity and that is to be removed or access to which is to be disabled,
        and information reasonably sufficient to permit us to locate the material; (iv) your contact information, including your address, telephone number, and an email address; (v) a statement by you that you have a good faith belief that use of the

        of the copyright owner. We reserve the right to remove Content alleged to be infringing without prior notice and at our sole discretion. In appropriate circumstances, Muve will also terminate a user’s account if the user is determined to be a

      <h2>10. Ending These Terms</h2>
      <hr style="width:50px; color: #2ECC71; background-color: #2ECC71; height: 2px; margin: 0px;" />

      <p style="margin-top: 20px;">
        The Terms will continue to apply until terminated by either you or Muve as follows. You may end your legal agreement with Muve at any time for any reason by deactivating your accounts and discontinuing your use of the Services. In order to deactivate
        your account, please contact us support@muveapp.com. We may suspend or terminate your accounts or cease providing you with all or part of the Services at any time for any reason, including, but not limited to, if we reasonably believe: (i) you
        have violated these Terms, (ii) you create risk or possible legal exposure for us; or (iii) our provision of the Services to you is no longer commercially viable. We will make reasonable efforts to notify you by the email address associated with
        your account or through the Services the next time you attempt to access your account. In all such cases, the Terms shall terminate, including, without limitation, your license to use the Services, except that the following sections shall continue
        to apply: 4, 5, 7, 8, 10, 11, and 12. Nothing in this section shall affect Muve's rights to change, limit or stop the provision of the Services without prior notice, as provided above in section 1.

        Each of the subsections below only applies up to the maximum extent permitted under applicable law. Some jurisdictions do not allow the disclaimer of implied warranties or the limitation of liability in contracts, and as a result the contents

      <h2>12. Payment</h2>
      <hr style="width:50px; color: #2ECC71; background-color: #2ECC71; height: 2px; margin: 0px;" />

      <p style="margin-top: 20px;">
        You understand that use of the Services may result in payments by you for the services you receive from a Third Party Provider ("Charges"). After you have received services obtained through your use of the Service, Muve will facilitate payment of the
        applicable Charges on behalf of the Third Party Provider, as such Third Party Provider's limited payment collection agent, using the preferred payment method designated in your Account, and will send you a receipt by email. Payment of the Charges
        in such manner shall be considered the same as payment made directly by you to the Third Party Provider. Charges will be inclusive of applicable taxes where required by law. Charges paid by you are final and non-refundable, unless otherwise determined
        by Muve. You retain the right to request lower Charges from a Third Party Provider for services received by you from such Third Party Provider at the time you receive such services. Muve will respond accordingly to any request from a Third Party
        Provider to modify the Charges for a particular service.
        <br />
        <br /> All Charges are due immediately and payment will be facilitated by Muve using the preferred payment method designated in your Account. If your primary Account payment method is determined to be expired, invalid or otherwise not able to
        be charged, you agree that Muve may, as the Third Party Provider's limited payment collection agent, use a secondary payment method in your Account, if available.
        <br />
        <br /> Muve reserves the right to establish, remove and/or revise Charges for any or all aspects of the Services at any time in Muve’s sole discretion. Further, you acknowledge and agree that Charges applicable in certain geographical areas may
        increase substantially during times of high demand of the Services. Muve will use reasonable efforts to inform you of Charges that may apply, provided that you will be responsible for Charges incurred under your Account regardless of your awareness
        of such Charges or the amounts thereof. Muve may from time to time provide certain users with promotional offers and discounts that may result in different Charges for the same or similar Services, and you agree that such promotional offers and
        discounts, unless also made available to you, shall have no bearing on your use of the Services or the Charges applied to you. You may elect to cancel your request for Services from a Third Party Provider at any time prior to such Third Party
        Provider's arrival, in which case you may be charged a cancellation fee.
        <br />
        <br /> This payment structure is intended to fully compensate the Third Party Provider for the services provided. Muve does not designate any portion of your payment as a tip or gratuity to the Third Party Provider. You understand and agree that,
        while you are free to provide additional payment as a gratuity to any Third Party Provider who provides you with services obtained through the Service, you are under no obligation to do so. Gratuities are voluntary. After you have received services
        obtained through the Service, you will have the opportunity to rate your experience and leave additional feedback about your Third Party Provider. In the event you feel unwelcome pressure to provide a gratuity, you may factor that experience into
        the rating or additional feedback you give.
        <br />
        <br />
        <strong>DAMAGES</strong>
        <br />
        <br /> If an item or something that belongs to you is damaged during the extent of a Muve request, Muve is in no way responsible or accountable for covering those damages. However, you can submit a claim to support@muveapp.com and it can go through
        the claims process. The claims process may include communication with the Moving Provider in order to settle any disputes.
